# DeathTimer
An WoW addon which shows estimated death time for target.  

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deathtimer/  

This addon currently has:
* A frame to show target time to die
* Basic config GUI

Changing target will give new time immediately.  
PvP target or bosses with special mechanisms may give wrong result.
